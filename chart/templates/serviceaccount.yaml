# The ServiceAccount needs to be able to manage resources that
# might not be declated until after Subscriptions have been
# deployed (e.g. TektonConfig).
#
# If the ServiceAccount did not have admin privilegers, it
# would need the permission to edit roles. An attacker
# getting access to this ServiceAccount would be able
# to grant any role to any account.
# Therefore the attack surface is not increased by giving
# the admin role to the ServiceAccount.
